    "### Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will use AI tools to help you generate, refactor, and explain code. Ideally, use GitHub Copilot, but if you cannot install the software, feel free to use other available tools (free or otherwise). Please name the tools you use in your assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main idea is to use natural language as much as possible, whilst remaining attentive to any mistakes the AI tool may produce. Your code should run without issues and provide the correct results. Please feel free to include tests and screenshots.\n",
    "\n",
    "As always, should you have any questions, please let me know.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use the `/explain` command in Copilot to get an explanation of the following code snippet:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def fibonacci(n):\n",
    "    if n <= 0:\n",
    "        return []\n",
    "    elif n == 1:\n",
    "        return [0]\n",
    "    elif n == 2:\n",
    "        return [0, 1]\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        fib = [0, 1]\n",
    "        for i in range(2, n):\n",
    "            fib.append(fib[i-1] + fib[i-2])\n",
    "        return fib\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Create a new Git repository using GitHub CLI and Copilot suggestions. The suggestions should include code to initialise the repository, add a `README.md` and a `.gitignore` file for Python projects, then add, commit, and push the changes to the repository. Please include the link to your repository below.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Use Copilot to refactor the following code to improve its efficiency and readability:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def is_prime(num):\n",
    "    if num <= 1:\n",
    "        return False\n",
    "    for i in range(2, num):\n",
    "        if num % i == 0:\n",
    "            return False\n",
    "    return True\n",
    "\n",
    "primes = []\n",
    "for i in range(1, 101):\n",
    "    if is_prime(i):\n",
    "        primes.append(i)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(primes)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Use the `@terminal` command to generate CLI commands that create a new directory named `data_analysis`, navigate into the directory, create a new Python file called `analysis.py`, and add a shebang line (`#!/usr/bin/env python`) at the top of the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Write a Python function that calculates the factorial of a number. Deliberately introduce an error in the function, then use Copilot's `/fix` command to identify and correct the issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Use Copilot to generate documentation comments for the following `R` factorial function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```r\n",
    "calculate_factorial <- function(n) {\n",
    "  if (n == 0) {\n",
    "    return(1)\n",
    "  } else {\n",
    "    return(n * calculate_factorial(n - 1))\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Use the `/explain` command to get an explanation for the following Python code snippet:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def normalize_data(data):\n",
    "    min_val = min(data)\n",
    "    max_val = max(data)\n",
    "    return [(x - min_val) / (max_val - min_val) for x in data]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Ask Copilot to translate the following `R` code to `Python`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```r\n",
    "library(tidyverse)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a sample dataframe with missing values\n",
    "df <- tibble(\n",
    "  A = c(1, 2, NA, 4, 5),\n",
    "  B = c(NA, 2, 3, 4, 5),\n",
    "  C = c(1, 2, 3, NA, 5),\n",
    "  D = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Define the function\n",
    "count_missing_values <- function(df) {\n",
    "  sapply(df, function(col) sum(is.na(col)))\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Test the function\n",
    "result <- count_missing_values(df)\n",
    "print(result)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Write a function in both `R` and `Python` that takes a string and returns the number of vowels in the string.\n",

    "10. Ask Copilot to translate the following binary code into text:\n",
    "\n",

    "1. By using /explain, GitHub Copilot returned the following explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"The provided code defines a Python function named fibonacci that generates a list containing the first n numbers in the Fibonacci sequence. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting with 0 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function begins by handling edge cases. If the input n is less than or equal to 0, the function returns an empty list, as a non-positive number of terms in the sequence is invalid. If n equals 1, the function returns a list containing only the first Fibonacci number, [0]. Similarly, if n equals 2, it returns the first two Fibonacci numbers, [0, 1].\n",
    "\n",
    "For cases where n is greater than 2, the function initializes a list fib with the first two Fibonacci numbers, [0, 1]. It then uses a for loop to calculate the remaining numbers in the sequence. The loop starts at index 2 and iterates up to n - 1. During each iteration, the next Fibonacci number is calculated as the sum of the two preceding numbers in the list (fib[i-1] + fib[i-2]) and appended to the fib list.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The reason for starting at 3 and skipping even numbers is that even numbers (other than 2) cannot be prime, so they are excluded to optimize the process. The square root of num is used as the upper limit because if num has a divisor larger than its square root, the corresponding smaller divisor would already have been found earlier in the loop.\n",

    "7. Copilot gave the following explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "The provided Python function, normalize_data, is designed to normalize a list of numerical data. Normalization is a common preprocessing step in data analysis and machine learning, where the goal is to scale data values to a specific range, typically between 0 and 1. This ensures that all data points are on the same scale, which can improve the performance of algorithms that are sensitive to the magnitude of the input values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function takes a single argument, data, which is expected to be a list of numerical values. It begins by calculating the minimum value (min_val) and the maximum value (max_val) of the input list using Python's built-in min() and max() functions. These values are essential for determining the range of the data, which is the difference between the maximum and minimum values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, the function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each value x in the input list. For each value, it applies the normalization formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "normalized_value=(x − min_val)/(max_val − min_val)\n",
    "​\n",
    " \n",
    "This formula shifts the data by subtracting the minimum value, ensuring that the smallest value in the dataset becomes 0. It then scales the result by dividing by the range of the data, so the largest value becomes 1. The result is a new list where all values are scaled to the range [0, 1].\n",
    "\n",
    "One potential issue with this function is that it does not handle cases where all values in the input list are the same. In such cases, the range (max_val - min_val) would be 0, leading to a division by zero error. To make the function more robust, you could add a check to handle this edge case.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, this function is a simple and efficient way to normalize a dataset, but it assumes that the input list contains at least two distinct values."
